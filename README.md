\# Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¬



A simple \*\*Streamlit + ML\*\* app that recommends 5 similar movies when you pick one.



\## How it works (very simple)

\- `movies.pkl` has movie info (title, id, tags)

\- `similarity.pkl` has similarity scores (cosine similarity of tags)

\- When you select a movie, we show the top 5 similar ones

\- (Optional) Posters via TMDB API



\## Run locally

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py
