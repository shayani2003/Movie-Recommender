# Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¬

<img src="">


A simple **Streamlit + ML** app that recommends 5 similar movies when you pick one.



### How it works (very simple)

\- `movies.pkl` has movie info (title, id, tags)

\- `similarity.pkl` has similarity scores (cosine similarity of tags)

\- When you select a movie, we show the top 5 similar ones

\- (Optional) Posters via TMDB API



## Run locally

```bash

streamlit run app.py
